# jsauthapi
Quick authentication api I made for another project its not the best but it works. Made in Javascript and used json file for keys or anything you want also has an expiry

# Updated!

I have added an api for other purposes. Includes: banning, unbanning, list all users, and remove users
i have added config.json so it is easier to edit and i have made it so you can enable and disable logs
I have added an anti spam feature where if the users sent over 10 requests they would be banned for 120s(changable in config.json)

# Coming soon!
Will add to the api
- create user function 
- edit users info like discord name or expiry

Will make a discord bot to ban, unban, remove, and create users.
